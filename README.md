## Hey, I'm Amanda! 🎐🪸🐠

I am an undergraduate student at UC Davis, where I'm studying Data Science. I'm interested in researching the mathematical models behind human behavior and complexity.

- 🔭 I'm currently interning at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
- 📕 At school, I work as a data analytics consultant. Various departments, like Athletics, or the Food Pantry, call me up to help them interpret data.
- 💡 Fun fact: my goal is to run every street in Davis before I graduate.

My coursework includes: Data Structures; Algorithms; Databases; Statistical Data Science; Simulating Communication Processes. My favorite class was a comparitive history seminar on graphic novels.
